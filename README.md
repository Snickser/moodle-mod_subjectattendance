The Subject Attendance module provides tools for manual recording of student attendance on individual course topics. The teacher is able to record the presence and participation of students in specific classes related to certain topics, as well as store and view this data in a convenient form. This approach provides detailed control over the mastery of the material and contributes to a more objective assessment of student involvement in the educational process.

In the list of students, the teacher marks one of three states (red, yellow, green), and can view statistics on the total number of marks. This is a very simple and straightforward way to mark - attendance, involvement, and can even be an alternative to the grade book.
