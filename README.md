*****
In the list of students, the teacher marks one of three states (red, yellow, green), and can view statistics on the total number of marks. This is a very simple and straightforward way to mark - attendance, involvement, and can even be an alternative to the grade book.
The list of topics is set in the settings and can be expanded and deleted.
